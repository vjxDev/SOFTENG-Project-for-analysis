This is the FermaT Transformation Engine by Martin Ward
(martin@gkc.org.uk)

Requirements:  you need to have perl version 5.6 or later installed.
For the dataflow functions, including the Static Single Assignment
and Slicing transformations, you need two perl modules installed:
Set::IntRange and Bit::Vector which you can download from www.cpan.org
Use "perl -MCPAN -e shell" to start a CPAN shell and type the commands:
install Bit::Vector
install Set::IntRange

Source either DOIT.csh, DOIT.sh or DOIT.bash into your shell to set
the path and environment variables (eg if your shell is csh or tcsh
then type "source DOIT.csh").

Type "make test" to build and test FermaT.

See INSTALL for more details about the installation. There is
also a separate guide "install-fermat-on-linux" in the "doc" directory.

See the doc directory for more documentation.

FermaT has been tested under Linux, Solaris 5.5.1, Solaris 2.8,
Alpha, HP-UX B.11.00 and Windows ME.
